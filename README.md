#Lesson 3
##Merge Conflict Example
This lesson will cover a simple merge conflict within git. I will be using the code example found online here: https://coderwall.com/p/o1psnw/handle-a-git-merge-conflict. The code for the files used can be found in the corresponding repo here: https://github.com/connor11528/mergeConflicting/commit/b6e98b1643cd5befa7303bdf0653e322f445bdd1.
